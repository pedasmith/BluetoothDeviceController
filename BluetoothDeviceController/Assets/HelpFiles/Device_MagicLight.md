# Magic Light and Flux smart bulb device

These bulbs have different names and they are controlled with different apps -- and yet, they are the same bulb 
and are controlled with the same Bluetooth protocol. (It's almost identical to the Triones protocol that some 
other bulbs use). The Magic Light and the Flux light both show up as a "LEDBlue" device. They do not need to be paired.

There are three tabs for these devices: color, demo modes, and white. 

# Color tab

The Color tab lets you set the exact color of the bulb using a color picker. You can
point to the color you want or you can type in the red, green, and blue values directly.

# Demo mode

The demos all work (unlike on some Triones lights)

# White tab

The white tab is used when you just want pure white light. That tab also includes a power 
switch to turn the bulb on and off. When a bulb is off, just setting the color won't
turn it on; you have to also press the power switch.
