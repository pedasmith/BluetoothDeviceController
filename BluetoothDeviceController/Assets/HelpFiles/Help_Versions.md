# Bluetooth Device Controller Versions

## Version 1.10, 2022-12-31

Added support for the Govee H5074 temperature and humidity sensor (via advertisements), the SwitchBot Thermometer and Hygrometer, and many of the Lionel LionChief Bluetooth-controlled trains.Also supported are the Particula GoDice dice. There is very early support for the awesome PokitPro Bluetooth multimeter.

The UI was redesigned; it more carefully splits the user interface for people who want to control their Bluetooth devices (most people) and people who want to explore their Bluetooth environment.

You can't see it, but many of the Bluetooth pages are automatically generated from a description file. The generator code was entirely rewritten to be more flexible.
