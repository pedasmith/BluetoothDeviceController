The UI was redesigned; it more carefully splits the user interface for people who want to control their Bluetooth devices (most people) and people who want to explore their Bluetooth environment.

You can't see it, but many of the Bluetooth pages are automatically generated from a description file. The generator code was entirely rewritten to be more flexible.
