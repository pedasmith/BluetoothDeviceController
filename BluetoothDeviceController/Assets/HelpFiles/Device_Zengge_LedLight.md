# The Magic Light IOTWF8FF (2024) from 

The Magic Light bulbs (2024) are slightly different from the original Magic Light bulbs and use an incompatible protocol. There are apparently other bulbs as well that use the same "Zenggee" protocol.

The Magic Light bulbs will show up as a IOTWF8FF bulb in the program.

## Pairing and using the device

The bulbs do not need to be paired to use.
