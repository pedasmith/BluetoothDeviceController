# Pan, Zoom, Reticule TODO list

This is the list of all the work needed to make the pan, zoom, reticule look good.

## Reticule

### Reticule zoom
Should be based on screen (e.g., always have 10 bars on the screen). Right now when you zoom in, the result is that you only see a couple of reticule lines

### Minor reticule lines
Having just the major lines is silly. There should be minor lines (10 per major line)

### Color and size
Reticule color and size should be updated to look classier

### Scale marker
There's no scale marker, so you can't tell how big a division is

## Panning

### Clipping
You should not be able to pan beyond the waveform. Note that a little bit of padding is OK

### Keyboard UX
Must ensure a keyboard UX. Should be usable both from a laptop keyboard and from just a keypad.

## Zooming

### Clipping
There should be a min and max zoom level.

### Keyboard UX
Must ensure a keyboard UX. Should be usable both from a laptop keyboard and from just a keypad.



## Status 2024-07-05 Pand and Zoom OK

Panning and zoom are basically OK
